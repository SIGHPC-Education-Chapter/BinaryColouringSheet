# Binary Colouring Activity

## One-Liner Description:

Binary - the system computers use to represent numbers and data - learn how to turn numbers into binary and colour in a picture.

## Extended Description:

We use basic arithemtic in daily life, we work in base 10 - decimal - yet how many people could actually tell you that? How many people could tell you that computers are based around binary when it carries out arithmetic or stores data.

This activity looks at the basic idea of converting a decimal number to a binary number. It contains in the initial handout a small method for converting a number from base 10 to base 2.

Using this, it asks the participant to colour in a "pixel art" image. The colour table is in base 10 but all the boxes are in binary. This should encourage the participant to do the conversion once for each colour and use that to identify the colours in the art.

## Concepts

Data Representation - How computers represent data internally
Numbers - Core to how science and data interact.

## Complexity

This activity can take approximately 15 minutes but can vary depending on the inidividuals involved. With help, younger children can do it - mainly surrounding the arithmetic operations.

It is a minimal introduction to basic binary - aimed at primary education rather than teenagers.

## Learning Outcomes

  * Able to convert low decimal numbers to binary.
  * Recognition of binary numbers.

## Pre-Requisites

  * Basic Arithmetic

## Required Equipment

  * Printed Sheets (currently Excel file in repository)
  * Crayons/Colour Pencils

## Duration

Approximately 15 minutes - or take away for own use.

## Group Size

No limit - solo activity
